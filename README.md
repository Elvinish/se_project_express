# 👕 WTWR (What to Wear?) – Back End

This is the back-end server for the WTWR (What to Wear?) web application, which helps users choose suitable clothing based on the current weather. The server provides a RESTful API for user management, clothing item CRUD operations, and user authentication.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

The WTWR back-end is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It provides a robust API that supports:

- User registration and login with secure password hashing
- JWT-based authentication
- CRUD operations for clothing items
- Like/dislike functionality for items
- Field-level validation and error handling
- Input restrictions using Mongoose schema validation

The project is structured to support future front-end integration and eventual deployment to a remote production server.

## 🛠 Technologies & Techniques Used

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for the server
- **Express** – Minimalist web framework for building API routes and middleware
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** – NoSQL database with object modeling
- **ESLint** – Code linting and formatting (Airbnb + Prettier config)
- **Joi / Celebrate** – Optional: input validation middleware (if added later)
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – Authentication and authorization
- **Bcrypt** – Password hashing
- **dotenv** – Secure environment variable management
- **Helmet** – Security middleware to set HTTP headers
- **CORS** – Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
- **Custom Error Handling** – Consistent error messages and status codes
- **Deployment Ready** – Structure prepared for remote hosting on platforms like Render, Heroku, or AWS
